# Next.js, React Query, and BFF Integration for Scalable Data Fetching

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a talk on integrating Next.js, React Query, and the Backend for Frontend (BFF) design pattern to achieve performant and scalable data fetching in React applications. This integration showcases how to leverage these technologies to enhance user experience and application performance through efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.

## Overview

The talk explores the synergy between Next.js, React Query, and the BFF design pattern, highlighting their roles in solving the challenges of data fetching in modern web applications. By combining these technologies, developers can create React applications that are both performant and scalable, with efficient data management strategies.

### Key Topics:

- **Next.js Capabilities**: Utilizing Next.js for server rendering, data prefetching, and route prefetching in React applications.
- **React Query**: Simplifying data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updates in React applications through server state hydration.
- **BFF Design Pattern**: Enhancing application performance and user experience by integrating a BFF with Next.js API handlers, acting as a proxy for data fetching.
